BigMLer - A command-line tool for BigML's API
=============================================

BigMLer makes `BigML <https://bigml.com>`_ even easier.

BigMLer wraps `BigML's API Python bindings <http://bigml.readthedocs.org>`_  to
offer a high-level command-line script to easily create and publish datasets
and models, create ensembles,
make local predictions from multiple models, clusters and simplify many other
machine learning tasks.

Used to generate reports for the analyze subcommand showing the ROC curve and
 evaluation metrics of cross-validations. See
:ref:`bigmler-report`.


Quick Start
===========

Let's see some basic usage examples. Check the
`installation <#bigmler-installation>`_ and
`authentication <#bigml-authentication>`_
sections below if you are not familiar with BigML.

Basics
------

You can create a new model just with


.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv

If you check your `dashboard at BigML <https://bigml.com/dashboard>`_, you will
see a new source, dataset, and model. Isn't it magic?

You can generate predictions for a test set using

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --test data/test_iris.csv

You can also specify a file name to save the newly created predictions

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --test data/test_iris.csv --output predictions

If you do not specify the path to an output file, BigMLer will auto-generate
one for you under a
new directory named after the current date and time
(e.g., `MonNov1212_174715/predictions.csv`). With ``--prediction-info``
flag set to ``brief`` only the prediction result will be stored (default is
``normal`` and includes confidence information). You can also set it to
``full`` if you prefer the result to be presented as a row with your test
input data followed by the corresponding prediction. To include a headers row
in the prediction file you can set ``--prediction-header``. For both the
``--prediction-info full`` and ``--prediction-info brief`` options, if you
want to include a subset of the fields in your test file you can select them by
setting ``--prediction-fields`` to a comma-separated list of them. Then


.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --test data/test_iris.csv \
            --prediction-info full --prediction-header \
            --prediction-fields 'petal length','petal width'

will include in the generated predictions file a headers row


.. code-block:: bash

    petal length,petal width,species,confidence

and only the values of ``petal length`` and ``petal width`` will be shown
before the objective field prediction ``species``.

A different ``objective field`` (the field that you want to predict) can be
selected using


.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --test data/test_iris.csv \
            --objective 'sepal length'

If you do not explicitly specify an objective field, BigML will default to the
last
column in your dataset. You can also use as selector the field column number
instead of the name (when --no-train-header is used, for instance).

Also, if your test file uses a particular field separator for its data,
you can tell BigMLer using ``--test-separator``.
For example, if your test file uses the tab character as field separator the
call should be like


.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --test data/test_iris.tsv \
            --test-separator '\t'

The model's predictions in BigMLer are based on the mean of the distribution
of training values in the predicted node. In case you would like to use the
median instead, you could just add the ``--median`` flag to your command

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/grades.csv --test data/test_grades.csv \
            --median

Note that this flag can only be applied to regression models.

If you don't provide a file name for your training source, BigMLer will try to
read it from the standard input

.. code-block:: bash

    cat data/iris.csv | bigmler --train

or you can also read the test info from there

.. code-block:: bash

    cat data/test_iris.csv | bigmler --train data/iris.csv --test

BigMLer will try to use the locale of the model both to create a new source
(if the ``--train`` flag is used) and to interpret test data. In case
it fails, it will try ``en_US.UTF-8``
or ``English_United States.1252`` and a warning message will be printed.
If you want to change this behaviour you can specify your preferred locale

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --test data/test_iris.csv \
            --locale "English_United States.1252"

If you check your working directory you will see that BigMLer creates a file
with the
model ids that have been generated (e.g., FriNov0912_223645/models).
This file is handy if then you want to use those model ids to generate local
predictions. BigMLer also creates a file with the dataset id that has been
generated (e.g., TueNov1312_003451/dataset) and another one summarizing
the steps taken in the session progress: ``bigmler_sessions``. You can also
store a copy of every created or retrieved resource in your output directory
(e.g., TueNov1312_003451/model_50c23e5e035d07305a00004f) by setting the flag
``--store``.

Remote Predictions
------------------

All the predictions we saw in the previous section are computed locally in
your computer. BigMLer allows you to ask for a remote computation by adding
the ``--remote`` flag. Remote computations are treated as batch computations.
This means that your test data will be loaded in BigML as a regular source and
the corresponding dataset will be created and fed as input data to your
model to generate a remote ``batch prediction`` object. BigMLer will download
the predictions file created as a result of this ``batch prediction`` and
save it to local storage just as it did for local predictions

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --test data/test_iris.csv \
            --remote --output my_dir/remote_predictions.csv

This command will create a source, dataset and model for your training data,
a source and dataset for your test data and a batch prediction using the model
and the test dataset. The results will be stored in the
``my_dir/remote_predictions.csv`` file. If you prefer the result not to be
dowloaded but to be stored as a new dataset remotely, add ``--no-csv`` and
``to-dataset`` to the command line. This can be specially helpful when
dealing with a high number of scores or when adding to the final result
the original dataset fields with ``--prediction-info full``, that may result
in a large CSV to be created as output.


In case you prefer BigMLer to issue
one-by-one remote prediction calls, you can use the ``--no-batch`` flag

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --test data/test_iris.csv \
            --remote --no-batch

Remote Sources
--------------

You can create models using remote sources as well. You just need a valid URL
that points to your data.
BigML recognizes a growing list of schemas (**http**, **https**, **s3**,
**azure**, **odata**, etc). For example

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train https://test:test@static.bigml.com/csv/iris.csv

    bigmler --train "s3://bigml-public/csv/iris.csv?access-key=[your-access-key]&secret-key=[your-secret-key]"

    bigmler --train azure://csv/diabetes.csv?AccountName=bigmlpublic

    bigmler --train odata://api.datamarket.azure.com/www.bcn.cat/BCNOFFERING0005/v1/CARRegistration?$top=100

Can you imagine how powerful this feature is? You can create predictive
models for huge
amounts of data without using you local CPU, memory, disk or bandwidth.
Welcome to the cloud!!!


Ensembles
---------

You can also easily create ensembles. For example, using
`bagging <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_aggregating>`_ is as easy as

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --test data/test_iris.csv \
            --number-of-models 10 --sample-rate 0.75 --replacement \
            --tag my_ensemble

To create a
`random decision forest <http://www.quora.com/Machine-Learning/How-do-random-forests-work-in-laymans-terms>`_
just use the `--randomize` option

.. code-block:: bash

     bigmler --train data/iris.csv --test data/test_iris.csv \
             --number-of-models 10 --sample-rate 0.75 --replacement \
             --tag my_ensemble --randomize

The fields to choose from will be randomized at each split creating a random
decision forest that when used together will increase the prediction
performance of the individual models.

Once you have an existing ensemble, you can use it to predict.
You can do so with the command

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --ensemble ensemble/51901f4337203f3a9a000215 \
            --test data/test_iris.csv

Or if you want to evaluate it

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --ensemble ensemble/51901f4337203f3a9a000215 \
            --test data/iris.csv --evaluate

There are some more advanced options that can help you build local predictions
with your ensembles.
When the number of local models becomes quite large holding all the models in
memory may exhaust your resources. To avoid this problem you can use the
``--max_batch_models`` flag which controls how many local models are held
in memory at the same time

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --test data/test_iris.csv \
            --number-of-models 10 --sample-rate 0.75 --max-batch-models 5

The predictions generated when using this option will be stored in a file per
model and named after the
models' id (e.g. `model_50c23e5e035d07305a00004f__predictions.csv"). Each line
contains the prediction, its confidence, the node's distribution and the node's
total number of instances. The default value for ``max-batch-models`` is 10.

When using ensembles, model's predictions are combined to issue a final
prediction. There are several different methods to build the combination.
You can choose ``plurality``, ``confidence weighted``, ``probability weighted``
or ``threshold`` using the ``--method`` flag

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --test data/test_iris.csv \
            --number-of-models 10 --sample-rate 0.75 \
            --method "confidence weighted"

For classification ensembles, the combination is made by majority vote:
``plurality`` weights each model's prediction as one vote,
``confidence weighted`` uses confidences as weight for the prediction,
``probability weighted`` uses the probability of the class in the distribution
of classes in the node as weight, and ``threshold`` uses an integer number
as threshold and a class name to issue the prediction: if the votes for
the chosen class reach the threshold value, then the class is predicted
and plurality for the rest of predictions is used otherwise

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --test data/test_iris.csv \
            --number-of-models 10 --sample-rate 0.75 \
            --method threshold --threshold 4 --class 'Iris-setosa'

For regression ensembles, the predicted values are averaged: ``plurality``
again weights each predicted value as one,
``confidence weighted`` weights each prediction according to the associated
error and ``probability weighted`` gives the same results as ``plurality``.

As in the model's case, you can base your prediction on the median of the
predicted node's distribution by adding ``--median`` to your BigMLer command.

It is also possible to enlarge the number of models that build your prediction
gradually. You can build more than one ensemble for the same test data and
combine the votes of all of them by using the flag ``combine_votes``
followed by the comma separated list of directories where predictions are
stored. For instance

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --test data/test_iris.csv \
            --number-of-models 20 --sample-rate 0.75 \
            --output ./dir1/predictions.csv
    bigmler --dataset dataset/50c23e5e035d07305a000056 \
            --test data/test_iris.csv  --number-of-models 20 \
            --sample-rate 0.75 --output ./dir2/predictions.csv
    bigmler --combine-votes ./dir1,./dir2

would generate a set of 20 prediction files, one for each model, in ``./dir1``,
a similar set in ``./dir2`` and combine all of them to generate the final
prediction.


Making your Dataset and Model public or share it privately
----------------------------------------------------------

Creating a model and making it public in BigML's gallery is as easy as

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --white-box

If you just want to share it as a black-box model just use

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --black-box

If you also want to make public your dataset

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --public-dataset

You can also share your datasets, models and evaluations privately with
whomever you choose by generating a private link. The ``--shared`` flag will
create such a link

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --dataset dataset/534487ef37203f0d6b000894 --shared --no-model

and the link will be listed in the output of the command

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --dataset dataset/534487ef37203f0d6b000894 --shared --no-model
    [2014-04-18 09:29:27] Retrieving dataset. https://bigml.com/dashboard/dataset/534487ef37203f0d6b000894
    [2014-04-18 09:29:30] Updating dataset. https://bigml.com/dashboard/dataset/534487ef37203f0d6b000894
    [2014-04-18 09:29:30] Shared dataset link. https://bigml.com/shared/dataset/8VPwG7Ny39g1mXBRD1sKQLuHrqE


or can also be found in the information pannel for the resource through the
web interface.

Content
-------

Before making your model public, probably you want to add a name, a category,
a description, and tags to your resources. This is easy too. For example

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --name "My model" --category 6 \
            --description data/description.txt --tag iris --tag my_tag

Please note:

    - You can get a full list of BigML category codes `here <https://bigml.com/developers/sources#s_categories>`_.
    - Descriptions are provided in a text file that can also include `markdown <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown>`_.
    - Many tags can be added to the same resource.
    - Use ``--no_tag`` if you do not want default BigMLer tags to be added.
    - BigMLer will add the name, category, description, and tags to all the
      newly created resources in each request.

Projects
--------

Each resource created in BigML can be associated to a ``project``. Projects are
intended for organizational purposes, and BigMLer can create projects
each time a ``source`` is created using a ``--project``
option. For instance

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --project "my new project"

will first check for the existence of a project by that name. If it exists,
will associate the source, dataset and model resources to this project.
If it doesn't, a new ``project`` is created and then associated.

You can also associate resources to an existing ``project`` by specifying
the option ``--project-id`` followed by its id

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --project-id project/524487ef37203f0d6b000894

Note: Once a ``source`` has been associated to a ``project``, all the resources
derived from this ``source`` will be automatically associated to the same
``project``.


Using previous Sources, Datasets, and Models
--------------------------------------------

You don't need to create a model from scratch every time that you use BigMLer.
You can generate predictions for a test set using a previously generated
model

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --model model/50a1f43deabcb404d3000079 --test data/test_iris.csv

You can also use a number of models providing a file with a model/id per line

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --models TueDec0412_174148/models --test data/test_iris.csv

Or all the models that were tagged with a specific tag

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --model-tag my_tag --test data/test_iris.csv

You can also use a previously generated dataset to create a new model

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --dataset dataset/50a1f441035d0706d9000371

You can also input the dataset from a file

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --datasets iris_dataset

A previously generated source can also be used to generate a new
dataset and model

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --source source/50a1e520eabcb404cd0000d1

And test sources and datasets can also be referenced by id in new
BigMLer requests for remote predictions

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --model model/52af53a437203f1cfe0001f0 --remote \
            --test-source source/52b0cbe637203f1d3e0015db

    bigmler --model model/52af53a437203f1cfe0001f0 --remote \
            --test-dataset dataset/52b0fb5637203f5c4f000018

Evaluations
-----------

BigMLer can also help you to measure the performance of your models. The
simplest way to build a model and evaluate it all at once is

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --evaluate

which will build the source, dataset and model objects for you using 80% of
the data in your training file chosen at random. After that, the remaining 20%
of the data will be run through the model to obtain
the corresponding evaluation. You can use the same procedure with a previously
existing source or dataset

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --source source/50a1e520eabcb404cd0000d1 --evaluate
    bigmler --dataset dataset/50a1f441035d0706d9000371 --evaluate

The results of an evaluation are stored both in txt and json files. Its
contents will follow the description given in the
`Developers guide, evaluation section <https://bigml.com/developers/evaluations>`_
and vary depending on the model being a classification or regression one.

Finally, you can also evaluate a preexisting model using a separate set of
data stored in a file or a previous dataset

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --model model/50a1f43deabcb404d3000079 --test data/iris.csv \
            --evaluate
    bigmler --model model/50a1f43deabcb404d3000079 \
            --test-dataset dataset/50a1f441035d0706d9000371 --evaluate

As for predictions, you can specify a particular file name to store the
evaluation in

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --evaluate --output my_dir/evaluation

Cross-validation
----------------

If you need cross-validation techniques to ponder which parameters (like
the ones related to different kinds of pruning) can improve the quality of your
models, you can use the ``--cross-validation-rate`` flag to settle the
part of your training data that will be separated for cross validation. BigMLer
will use a Monte-Carlo cross-validation variant, building ``2*n`` different
models, each of which is constructed by a subset of the training data,
holding out randomly ``n%`` of the instances. The held-out data will then be
used to evaluate the corresponding model. For instance, both

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --cross-validation-rate 0.02
    bigmler --dataset dataset/519029ae37203f3a9a0002bf \
            --cross-validation-rate 0.02

will hold out 2% of the training data to evaluate a model built upon the
remaining 98%. The evaluations will be averaged and the result saved
in json and human-readable formats in ``cross-validation.json`` and
``cross-validation.txt`` respectively. Of course, in this kind of
cross-validation you can choose the number of evaluations yourself by
setting the ``--number-of-evaluations`` flag. You should just keep in mind
that it must be high enough to ensure low variance, for instance

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --cross-validation-rate 0.1 \
            --number-of-evaluations 20

The ``--max-parallel-evaluations`` flag will help you limit the number of
parallel evaluation creation calls.

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --cross-validation-rate 0.1 \
            --number-of-evaluations 20 --max-parallel-evaluations 2


Configuring Datasets and Models
-------------------------------

What if your raw data isn't necessarily in the format that BigML expects? So we
have good news: you can use a number of options to configure your sources,
datasets, and models.

Imagine that you want to alter BigML's default field names or the ones provided
by the training set header and capitalize them, even to add a label or a
description to each field. You can use a text file with a change per line as
follows

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --field-attributes fields.csv

where ``fields.csv`` would be

.. code-block:: bash

    0,'SEPAL LENGTH','label for SEPAL LENGTH','description for SEPAL LENGTH'
    1,'SEPAL WIDTH','label for SEPAL WIDTH','description for SEPAL WIDTH'
    2,'PETAL LENGTH','label for PETAL LENGTH','description for PETAL LENGTH'
    3,'PETAL WIDTH','label for PETAL WIDTH','description for PETAL WIDTH'
    4,'SPECIES','label for SPECIES','description for SPECIES'

The number on the left in each line is the `column number` of the field in your
source and is followed by the new field's name, label and description.


Similarly you can also alter the auto-detect type behavior from BigML assigning
specific types to specific fields

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --types types.txt

where ``types.txt`` would be

.. code-block:: bash

    0, 'numeric'
    1, 'numeric'
    2, 'numeric'
    3, 'numeric'
    4, 'categorical'

You can specify the fields that you want to include in the dataset by naming
them explicitly

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv \
            --dataset-fields 'sepal length','sepal width','species'

or the fields that you want to include as predictors in the model

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --model-fields 'sepal length','sepal width'

You can also specify the chosen fields by adding or removing the ones you
choose to the list of preferred fields of the previous resource. Just prefix
their names with ``+`` or ``-`` respectively. For example,
you could create a model from an existing dataset using all their fields but
the ``sepal length`` by saying

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --dataset dataset/50a1f441035d0706d9000371 \
            --model-fields -'sepal length'


When evaluating, you can map the fields of the evaluated model to those of
the test dataset by writing in a file the field column of the model and
the field column of the dataset separated by a comma and using `--fields-map`
flag to specify the name of the file

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --dataset dataset/50a1f441035d0706d9000371 \
            --model model/50a1f43deabcb404d3000079 --evaluate \
            --fields-map fields_map.txt

where ``fields_map.txt`` would contain

.. code-block:: bash

    0, 1
    1, 0
    2, 2
    3, 3
    4, 4

if the first two fields had been reversed.

Finally, you can also tell BigML whether your training and test set come with a
header row or not. For example, if both come without header

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris_nh.csv --test data/test_iris_nh.csv \
            --no-train-header --no-test-header


Splitting Datasets
------------------

When following the usual proceedings to evaluate your models you'll need to
separate the available data in two sets: the training set and the test set. With
BigMLer you won't need to create two separate physical files. Instead, you
can set a ``--test-split`` flag that will set the percentage of data used to
build the test set and leave the rest for training. For instance

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --test-split 0.2 --name iris --evaluate

will build a source with your entire file contents, create the corresponding
dataset and split it in two: a test dataset with 20% of instances and a
training dataset with the remaining 80%. Then, a model will be created based on
the training set data and evaluated using the test set. By default, split is
deterministic, so that every time you issue the same command will get the
same split datasets. If you want to generate
different splits from a unique dataset you can set the ``--seed`` option to a
different string in every call

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --test-split 0.2 --name iris \
            --seed my_random_string_382734627364 --evaluate


Advanced Dataset management
---------------------------

As you can find in the BigML's API documentation on
`datasets <https://bigml.com/developers/datasets>`_ besides the basic name,
label and description that we discussed in previous sections, there are many
more configurable options in a dataset resource. In order to set or update
dataset options, you can use the ``--dataset-attributes`` option pointing
to a file path that contains the configuration settings in JSON format

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --dataset dataset/52b8a12037203f48bc00000a \
            --dataset-attributes my_dir/attributes.json

Let's say this dataset has a text field with id ``000001``. The
``attributes.json`` to change its text parsing mode to full field contents
would read

.. code-block:: bash

    {"fields": {"000001": {"term_analysis": {"token_mode": "full_terms_only"}}}}

There are other kinds of updatable options in the dataset besides controlling
its fields features. As an example, to publish a dataset in the
gallery and set its price you could use

.. code-block:: bash

    {"private": false, "price": 120.4}

Similarly, you might want to add fields to your existing dataset by combining
some of its fields or simply tagging their rows. Using BigMLer, you can set the
``--new-fields`` option to a file path that contains a JSON structure that
describes the fields you want to select or exclude from the original dataset,
or the ones you want to combine and
the `Flatline expression <https://github.com/bigmlcom/flatline>`_ to
combine them. This structure
must follow the rules of a specific languange described in the `Transformations
item of the developers
section <https://bigml.com/developers/transformations>`_

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --dataset dataset/52b8a12037203f48bc00000a \
            --new-fields my_dir/generators.json

To see a simple example, should you want to include all the fields but the
one with id ``000001`` and add a new one with a label depending on whether
the value of the field ``sepal length`` is smaller than 1,
you would write in ``generators.json``

.. code-block:: bash

    {"all_but": ["000001"], "new_fields": [{"name": "new_field", "field": "(if (< (f \"sepal length\") 1) \"small\" \"big\")"}]}

Or, as another example, to tag the outliers of the same field one coud use

.. code-block:: bash

    {"new_fields": [{"name": "outlier?", "field": "(if (within-percentiles? \"sepal length\" 0.5 0.95) \"normal\" \"outlier\")"}]}

You can also export the contents of a generated dataset by using the
``--to-csv`` option. Thus,

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --dataset dataset/52b8a12037203f48bc00000a \
            --to-csv my_dataset.csv --no-model

will create a CSV file named ``my_dataset.csv`` in the default directory
created by BigMLer to place the command output files. If no file name is given,
the file will be named after the dataset id.

A dataset can also be generated as the union of several datasets using the
flag ``--multi-dataset``. The datasets will be read from a file specified
in the ``--datasets`` option and the file must contain one dataset id per line.


.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --datasets my_datasets --multi-dataset --no-model

This syntax is used when all the datasets in the ``my_datasets`` file share
a common field structre, so the correspondence of the fields of all the
datasets is straight forward. In the general case, the multi-dataset will
inherit the field structure of the first component dataset.
If you want to build a multi-dataset with
datasets whose fields share not the same column disposition, you can specify
which fields are correlated to the ones of the first dataset
by mapping the fields of the rest of datasets to them.
The option ``--multi-dataset-attributes`` can point to a JSON
file that contains such a map. The command line syntax would then be

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --datasets my_datasets --multi-dataset \
            --multi-dataset-attributes my_fields_map.json \
            --no-model

and for a simple case where the second dataset had flipped the first and second
fields with respect to the first one, the file would read

.. code-block::

    {"fields_maps": {"dataset/53330bce37203f222e00004b": {"000000": "000001",
                                                          "000001": "000000"}}
    }

where ``dataset/53330bce37203f222e00004b`` would be the id of the
second dataset in the multi-dataset.


Model Weights
-------------

To deal with imbalanced datasets, BigMLer offers three options: ``--balance``,
``--weight-field`` and ``--objective-weights``.

For classification models, the ``--balance`` flag will cause all the classes
in the dataset to
contribute evenly. A weight will be assigned automatically to each
instance. This weight is
inversely proportional to the number of instances in the class it belongs to,
in order to ensure even distribution for the classes.

You can also use a field in the dataset that contains the weight you would like
to use for each instance. Using the ``--weight-field`` option followed by
the field name or column number will cause BigMLer to use its data as instance
weight. This is valid for both regression and classification models.

The ``--objective-weights`` option is used in classification models to
transmit to BigMLer what weight is assigned to each class. The option accepts
a path to a CSV file that should contain the ``class``,``weight`` values one
per row

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --dataset dataset/52b8a12037203f48bc00000a \
            --objective-weights my_weights.csv

where the ``my_weights.csv`` file could read

.. code-block:: bash

    Iris-setosa,5
    Iris-versicolor,3

so that BigMLer would associate a weight of ``5`` to the ``Iris-setosa``
class and ``3`` to the ``Iris-versicolor`` class. For additional classes
in the model, like ``Iris-virginica`` in the previous example,
weight ``1`` is used as default. All specified weights must be non-negative
numbers (with either integer or real values) and at least one of them must
be non-zero.

Predictions' missing strategy
-----------------------------

Sometimes the available data lacks some of the features our models use to
predict. In these occasions, BigML offers two different ways of handling
input data with missing values, that is to say, the missing strategy. When the
path to the prediction reaches a split point that checks
the value of a field which is missing in your input data, using the
``last prediction`` strategy the final prediction will be the prediction for
the last node in the path before that point, and using the ``proportional``
strategy it will be a weighted average of all the predictions for the final
nodes reached considering that both branches of the split are possible.

BigMLer adds the ``--missing-strategy`` option, that can be set either to
``last`` or ``proportional`` to choose the behavior in such cases. Last
prediction is the one used when this option is not used.

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --model model/52b8a12037203f48bc00001a \
            --missing-strategy proportional --test my_test.csv


Models with missing splits
--------------------------

Another configuration argument that can change models when
the training data has instances with missing values in some of its features
is ``--missing-splits``. By setting this flag, the model building algorithm
will be able to include the instances
that have missing values for the field used to split the data in each node
in one of the stemming branches. This will, obviously, affect also the
predictions given by the model for input data with missing values. Here's an
example to build
a model using missing-splits and predict with it.

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --dataset dataset/52b8a12037203f48bc00023b \
            --missing-splits --test my_test.csv


Fitering Sources
----------------

Imagine that you have create a new source and that you want to create a
specific dataset filtering the rows of the source that only meet certain
criteria.  You can do that using a JSON expresion as follows

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --source source/50a2bb64035d0706db0006cc --json-filter filter.json

where ``filter.json`` is a file containg a expression like this

.. code-block:: bash

    ["<", 7.00, ["field", "000000"]]

or a LISP expression as follows

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --source source/50a2bb64035d0706db0006cc --lisp-filter filter.lisp

where ``filter.lisp`` is a file containing a expression like this

.. code-block:: bash

    (< 7.00 (field "sepal length"))

For more details, see the BigML's API documentation on
`filtering rows <https://bigml.com/developers/datasets#d_filteringrows>`_.

Multi-labeled categories in training data
------------------------------------------

Sometimes the information you want to predict is not a single category but a
set of complementary categories. In this case, training data is usually
presented as a row of features and an objective field that contains the
associated set of categories joined by some kind of delimiter. BigMLer can
also handle this scenario.

Let's say you have a simple file

.. code-block:: bash

    color,year,sex,class
    red,2000,male,"Student,Teenager"
    green,1990,female,"Student,Adult"
    red,1995,female,"Teenager,Adult"

with information about a group of people and we want to predict the ``class``
another person will fall into. As you can see, each record has more
than one ``class`` per person (for example, the first person is labeled as
being both a ``Student`` and a ``Teenager``) and they are all stored in the
``class`` field by concatenating all the applicable labels using ``,`` as
separator. Each of these labels is, 'per se', an objective to be predicted, and
that's what we can rely on BigMLer to do.

The simplest multi-label command in BigMLer is

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --multi-label --train data/tiny_multilabel.csv

First, it will analyze the training file to extract all the ``labels`` stored
in the objective field. Then, a new extended file will be generated
from it by adding a new field per label. Each generated field will contain
a boolean set to
``True`` if the associated label is in the objective field and ``False``
otherwise

.. code-block:: bash

    color,year,sex,class - Adult,class - Student,class - Teenager
    red,2000,male,False,True,True
    green,1990,female,True,True,False
    red,1995,female,True,False,True

This new file will be fed to BigML to build a ``source``, a ``dataset`` and
a set of ``models`` using four input fields: the first three fields as
input features and one of the label fields as objective. Thus, each
of the classes that label the training set can be predicted independently using
one of the models.

But, naturally, when predicting a multi-labeled field you expect to obtain
all the labels that qualify the input features at once, as you provide them in
the training data records. That's also what BigMLer does. The syntax to
predict using
multi-labeled training data sets is similar to the single labeled case

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --multi-label --train data/tiny_multilabel.csv \
            --test data/tiny_test_multilabel.csv

the main difference being that the ouput file ``predictions.csv`` will have
the following structure

.. code-block:: bash

    "Adult,Student","0.34237,0.20654"
    "Adult,Teenager","0.34237,0.34237"

where the first column contains the ``class`` prediction and the second one the
confidences for each label prediction. If the models predict ``True`` for
more than one label, the prediction is presented as a sequence of labels
(and their corresponding confidences) delimited by ``,``.

As you may have noted, BigMLer uses ``,`` both as default training data fields
separator and as label separator. You can change this behaviour by using the
``--training-separator``, ``--label-separator`` and ``--test-separator`` flags
to use different one-character separators

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --multi-label --train data/multilabel.tsv \
            --test data/test_multilabel.tsv --training-separator '\t' \
            --test-separator '\t' --label-separator ':'

This command would use the ``tab`` character as train and test data field
delimiter and ``:`` as label delimiter (the examples in the tests set use
``,`` as field delimiter and ':' as label separator).

You can also choose to restrict the prediction to a subset of labels using
the ``--labels`` flag. The flag should be set to a comma-separated list of
labels. Setting this flag can also reduce the processing time for the
training file, because BigMLer will rely on them to produce the extended
version of the training file. Be careful, though, to avoid typos in the labels
in this case, or no objective fields will be created. Following the previous
example

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --multi-label --train data/multilabel.csv \
            --test data/test_multilabel.csv --label-separator ':' \
            --labels Adult,Student

will limit the predictions to the ``Adult`` and ``Student`` classes, leaving
out the ``Teenager`` classification.

Multi-labeled predictions can also be computed using ensembles, one for each
label. To create an ensemble prediction, use the ``--number-of-models`` option
that will set the number of models in each ensemble

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --multi-label --train data/multilabel.csv \
            --number-of-models 20 --label-separator ':' \
            --test data/test_multilabel.csv

The ids of the ensembles will be stored in an ``ensembles`` file in the output
directory, and can be used in other predictions by setting the ``--ensembles``
option

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --multi-label --ensembles multilabel/ensembles \
            --test data/test_multilabel.csv

or you can retrieve all previously tagged ensembles with ``--ensemble-tag``

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --multi-label --ensemble-tag multilabel \
            --test data/test_multilabel.csv


Multi-labeled resources
------------------------

The resources generated from a multi-labeled training data file can also be
recovered and used to generate more multi-labeled predictions. As in the
single-labeled case

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --multi-label --source source/522521bf37203f412f000100 \
            --test data/test_multilabel.csv

would generate a dataset and the corresponding set of models needed to create
a ``predictions.csv`` file that contains the multi-labeled predictions.

Similarly, starting from a previously created multi-labeled dataset

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --multi-label --dataset source/522521bf37203f412fac0135 \
            --test data/test_multilabel.csv --output multilabel/predictions.csv

creates a bunch of models, one per label, and predicts storing the results
of each operation in the ``multilabel`` directory, and finally

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --multi-label --models multilabel/models \
            --test data/test_multilabel.csv

will retrieve the set of models created in the last example and use them in new
predictions. In addition, for these three cases you can restrict the labels
to predict to a subset of the complete list available in the original objective
field. The ``--labels`` option can be set to a comma-separated list of the
selected labels in order to do so.

The ``--model-tag`` can be used as well to retrieve multi-labeled
models and predict with them

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --multi-label --model-tag my_multilabel \
            --test data/test_multilabel.csv

Finally, BigMLer is also able to handle training files with more than one
multi-labeled field. Using the ``--multi-label-fields`` option you can
settle the fields that will be expanded as containing multiple labels
in the generated source and dataset.

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --multi-label --multi-label-fields class,type \
            --train data/multilabel_multi.csv --objective class

This command creates a source (and its corresponding dataset)
where both the ``class`` and ``type`` fields have been analysed
to create a new field per label. Then the ``--objective`` option sets ``class``
to be the objective field and only the models needed to predict this field
are created. You could also create a new multi-label prediction for another
multi-label field, ``type`` in this case, by issuing a new BigMLer command
that uses the previously generated dataset as starting point

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --multi-label --dataset dataset/52cafddb035d07269000075b \
            --objective type

This would generate the models needed to predict ``type``. It's important to
remark that the models used to predict ``class`` in the first example will
use the rest of fields (including ``type`` as well as the ones generated
by expanding it) to build the prediction tree. If you don't want this
fields to be used in the model construction, you can set the ``--model-fields``
option to exclude them. For instance, if ``type`` has two labels, ``label1``
and ``label2``, then excluding them from the models that predict
``class`` could be achieved using

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --multi-label --dataset dataset/52cafddb035d07269000075b \
            --objective class
            --model-fields=' -type,-type - label1,-type - label2'

You can also generate new fields applying aggregation functions such as
``count``, ``first`` or ``last`` on the labels of the multi label fields. The
option ``--label-aggregates`` can be set to a comma-separated list of these
functions and a new column per multi label field and aggregation function
will be added to your source

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --multi-label --train data/multilabel.csv \
            --label-separator ':' --label-aggregates count,last \
            --objective class

will generate ``class - count`` and ``class - last`` in addition to the set
of per label fields.


Multi-label evaluations
-----------------------

Multi-label predictions are computed using a set of binary models
(or ensembles), one for
each label to predict. Each model can be evaluated to check its
performance. In order to do so, you can mimic the commands explained in the
``evaluations`` section for the single-label models and ensembles. Starting
from a local CSV file

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --multi-label --train data/multilabel.csv \
            --label-separator ":" --evaluate

will build the source, dataset and model objects for you using a
random 80% portion of data in your training file. After that, the remaining 20%
of the data will be run through each of the models to obtain an evaluation of
the corresponding model. BigMLer retrieves all evaluations and saves
them locally in json and txt format. They are named using the objective field
name and the value of the label that they refer to. Finally, it averages the
results obtained in all the evaluations to generate a mean evaluation stored
in the ``evaluation.txt`` and ``evaluation.json`` files. As an example,
if your objective field name is ``class`` and the labels it contains are
``Adult,Student``, the generated files will be

.. code-block:: bash

Generated files:

 MonNov0413_201326
  - evaluations
  - extended_multilabel.csv
  - source
  - evaluation_class_student.txt
  - models
  - evaluation_class_adult.json
  - dataset
  - evaluation.json
  - evaluation.txt
  - evaluation_class_student.json
  - bigmler_sessions
  - evaluation_class_adult.txt

You can use the same procedure with a previously
existing multi-label source or dataset

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --multi-label --source source/50a1e520eabcb404cd0000d1 \
            --evaluate
    bigmler --multi-label --dataset dataset/50a1f441035d0706d9000371 \
            --evaluate

Finally, you can also evaluate a preexisting set of models or ensembles
using a separate set of
data stored in a file or a previous dataset

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --multi-label --models MonNov0413_201326/models \
            --test data/test_multilabel.csv --evaluate
    bigmler --multi-label --ensembles MonNov0413_201328/ensembles \
            --dataset dataset/50a1f441035d0706d9000371 --evaluate


High number of Categories
-------------------------

In BigML there's a limit in the number of categories of a categorical
objective field. This limit is set to ensure the quality of the resulting
models. This may become a restriction when dealing with
categorical objective fields with a high number of categories. To cope with
these cases, BigMLer offers the --max-categories option. Setting to a number
lower than the mentioned limit, the existing categories will be organized in
subsets of that size. Then the original dataset will be copied many times, one
per subset, and its objective field will only keep the categories belonging to
each subset plus a generic ``***** other *****`` category that will summarize
the rest of categories. Then a model will be created from each dataset and
the test data will be run through them to generate partial predictions. The
final prediction will be extracted by choosing the class with highest
confidence from the distributions obtained for
each model's prediction ignoring the ``***** other ******`` generic category.
For instance, to use the same ``iris.csv`` example, you could do

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --max-categories 1 \
            --test data/test_iris.csv --objective species

This command would generate a source and dataset object, as usual, but then,
as the total number of categories is three and --max-categories is set to 1,
three more datasets will be created, one per each category. After generating
the corresponding models, the test data will be run through them and their
predictions combined to obtain the final predictions file. The same procedure
would be applied if starting from a preexisting source or dataset using the
``--source`` or ``--dataset`` options. Please note that the ``--objective``
flag is mandatory in this case to ensure that the right categorical field
is selected as objective field.

``--method`` option accepts a new ``combine`` value to use such kind of
combination. You can use it if you need to create a new group of predictions
based on the same models produced in the first example. Filling the path to the
model ids file

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --models my_dir/models --method combine \
            --test data/new_test.csv

the new predictions will be created. Also, you could use the set of datasets
created in the first case as starting point. Their ids are stored in a
``dataset_parts`` file that can be found in the output location

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --dataset my_dir/dataset_parts --method combine \
            --test data/test.csv

This command would cause a new set of models, one per dataset, to be generated
and their predictions would be combined in a final predictions file.


Advanced subcommands in BigMLer
===============================

.. _bigmler-analyze:

Analyze subcommand
------------------

In addition to the main BigMLer capabilities explained so far, there's a
subcommand ``bigmler analyze`` with more options to evaluate the performance
of your models. For instance

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler analyze --dataset dataset/5357eb2637203f1668000004 \
                    --cross-validation --k-folds 5

will create a k-fold cross-validation by dividing the data in your dataset in
the number of parts given in ``--k-folds``. Then evaluations are created by
selecting one of the parts to be the test set and using the rest of data
to build the model for testing. The generated
evaluations are placed in your output directory and its average is stored in
``evaluation.txt`` and ``evaluation.json``.

Similarly, you'll be able to create an evaluation for ensembles. Using the
same command above and adding the options to define the ensembles' properties,
such as ``--number-of-models``, ``--sample-rate``, ``--randomize`` or
``--replacement``

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler analyze --dataset dataset/5357eb2637203f1668000004 \
                    --cross-validation --k-folds 5 --number-of-models 20
                    --sample-rate 0.8 --replacement

More insights can be drawn from the ``bigmler analyze --features`` command. In
this case, the aim of the command is to analyze the complete set of features
in your dataset to single out the ones that produce models with better
evaluation scores. In this case, we focus on ``accuracy`` for categorical
objective fields and ``r-squared`` for regressions.



.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler analyze --dataset dataset/5357eb2637203f1668000004 \
                    --features

This command uses an algorithm for smart feature selection as described in this
`blog post <http://blog.bigml.com/2014/02/26/smart-feature-selection-with-scikit-learn-and-bigmls-api/>`_
that evaluates models built by using subsets of features. It starts by
building one model per feature, chooses the subset of features used in the
model that scores best and, from there on, repeats the procedure
by adding another of the available features in the dataset to the chosen
subset. The iteration stops when no improvement in score is found for a number
of repetitions that can be controlled using the ``--staleness`` option
(default is ``5``). There's
also a ``--penalty`` option (default is ``0.1%``) that sets the amount that
is substracted from the score per feature added to the
subset. This penalty is intended
to mitigate overfitting, but it also favors models which are quicker to build
and evaluate. The evaluations for the scores are k-fold cross-validations.
The ``--k-folds`` value is set to ``5`` by default, but you can change it
to whatever suits your needs using the ``--k-folds`` option.


.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler analyze --dataset dataset/5357eb2637203f1668000004 \
                    --features --k-folds 10 --staleness 3 --penalty 0.002

Would select the best subset of features using 10-fold cross-validation
and a ``0.2%`` penalty per feature, stopping after 3 non-improving iterations.

Depending on the machine learning problem you intend to tackle, you might
want to optimize other evaluation metric, such as ``precision`` or
``recall``. The ``--optimize`` option will allow you to set the evaluation
metric you'd like to optimize.



.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler analyze --dataset dataset/5357eb2637203f1668000004 \
                    --features --optimize recall

For categorical models, the evaluation values are obtained by counting
the positive and negative matches for all the instances in
the test set, but sometimes it can be more useful to optimize the
performance of the model for a single category. This can be specially
important in highly non-balanced datasets or when the cost function is
mainly associated to one of the existing classes in the objective field.
Using ``--optimize-category" you can set the category whose evaluation
metrics you'd like to optimize

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler analyze --dataset dataset/5357eb2637203f1668000004 \
                    --features --optimize recall \
                    --optimize-category Iris-setosa

You should be aware that the smart feature selection command still generates
a high number of BigML resources. Using ``k`` as the ``k-folds`` number and
``n`` as the number of explored feature sets, it will be generating ``k``
datasets (``1/k``th of the instances each), and ``k * n`` models and
evaluations. Setting the ``--max-parallel-models`` and
``--max-parallel-evaluations`` to higher values (up to ``k``) can help you
speed up partially the creation process because resources will be created
in parallel. You must keep in mind, though, that this parallelization is
limited by the task limit associated to your subscription or account type.

As another optimization method, the ``bigmler analyze --nodes`` subcommand
will find for you the best performing model by changing the number of nodes
in its tree. You provide the ``--min-nodes`` and ``--max-nodes`` that define
the range and ``--nodes-step`` controls the increment in each step. The command
runs a k-fold evaluation (see ``--k-folds`` option) on a model built with each
node threshold in you range and tries to optimize the evaluation metric you
chose (again, default is ``accuracy``). If improvement stops (see
the --staleness option) or the node threshold reaches the ``--max-nodes``
limit, the process ends and shows the node threshold that
lead to the best score.

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler analyze --dataset dataset/5357eb2637203f1668000004 \
                    --nodes --min-nodes 10 \
                    --max-nodes 200 --nodes-step 50


When working with random forest, you can also change the number of
``random_candidates`` or number of fields chosen at random when the models
in the forest are built. Using ``bigmler analyze --random-fields`` the number
of ``random_candidates`` will range from 1 to the number of fields in the
origin dataset, and BigMLer will cross-validate the random forests to determine
which ``random_candidates`` number gives the best performance.

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler analyze --dataset dataset/5357eb2637203f1668000004 \
                    --random-fields

Please note that, in general, the exact choice of fields selected as random
candidates might be more
important than their actual number. However, in some marginal cases (e.g.
datasets with a high number noise features) the number of random candidates
can impact tree performance significantly.


.. _bigmler-report:

Report subcommand
-----------------

The results of a ``bigmler analyze --features`` or ``bigmler analyze --nodes``
command are a series of k-fold cross-validations made on the training data that
leads to the configuration value that will create the best performant model.
However, the algorithm maximizes only one evaluation metric. To see the global
picture for the rest of metrics at each validation configuration you can build
a graphical report of the results using the ``report`` subcommand. Let's say
you previously ran

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler analyze --dataset dataset/5357eb2637203f1668000004 \
                    --nodes --output-dir best_recall

and you want to have a look at the results for each ``node_threshold``
configuration. Just say:

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler report --from-dir best_recall --port 8080

and the command will traverse the directories in ``best_recall`` and summarize
the results found there in a metrics comparison graphic and an ROC curve if
your
model is categorical. Then a simple HTTP server will be started locally and
bound to a port of your choice, ``8080`` in the example (``8085`` will be the
default value), and a new web browser
window will be started to show the results.
You can see an `example <http://bl.ocks.org/mmerce/4b65df897bff119416e2>`_
built on the well known diabetes dataset.

The HTTP server will create an auxiliary ``bigmler/reports`` directory in the
user's home directory, where symbolic links to the reports in each output
directory will be stored and served from.

.. _bigmler-cluster:

Cluster subcommand
------------------

Just as the simple ``bigmler`` command can generate all the
resources leading to finding models and predictions for a supervised learning
problem, the ``bigmler cluster`` subcommand will follow the steps to generate
clusters and predict the centroids associated to your test data. To mimic what
we saw in the ``bigmler`` command section, the simplest call is

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler cluster --train data/diabetes.csv

This command will upload the data in the ``data/diabetes.csv`` file and generate
the corresponding ``source``, ``dataset`` and ``cluster`` objects in BigML. You
can use any of the generated objects to produce new clusters. For instance, you
could set a subgroup of the fields of the generated dataset to produce a
different cluster by using

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler cluster --dataset dataset/53b1f71437203f5ac30004ed \
                    --cluster-fields="-blood pressure"

that would exclude the field ``blood pressure`` from the cluster creation input
fields.

Similarly to the models and datasets, the generated clusters can be shared
using the ``--shared`` option, e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler cluster --source source/53b1f71437203f5ac30004e0 \
                    --shared

will generate a secret link for both the created dataset and cluster that
can be used to share the resource selectively.

As models were used to generate predictions (class names in classification
problems and an estimated number for regressions), clusters can be used to
predict the subgroup of data that our input data is more similar to.
Each subgroup is represented by its centroid, and the centroid is labelled
by a centroid name. Thus, a cluster would classify our
test data by assigning to each input an associated centroid name. The command

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler cluster --cluster cluster/53b1f71437203f5ac30004f0 \
                    --test data/my_test.csv

would produce a file ``centroids.csv`` with the centroid name associated to
each input. When the command is executed, the cluster information is downloaded
to your local computer and the centroid predictions are computed locally, with
no more latencies involved. Just in case you prefer to use BigML to compute
the centroid predictions remotely, you can do so too

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler cluster --cluster cluster/53b1f71437203f5ac30004f0 \
                    --test data/my_test.csv --remote

would create a remote source and dataset from the test file data,
generate a ``batch centroid`` also remotely and finally download the result
to your computer. If you prefer the result not to be
dowloaded but to be stored as a new dataset remotely, add ``--no-csv`` and
``to-dataset`` to the command line. This can be specially helpful when
dealing with a high number of scores or when adding to the final result
the original dataset fields with ``--prediction-info full``, that may result
in a large CSV to be created as output.

The k-means algorithm used in clustering can only use training data that has
no missing values in their numeric fields. Any data that does not comply with
that is discarded in cluster construction, so you should ensure that enough
number of rows in your training data file has non-missing values in their
numeric fields for the cluster to be built and relevant. Similarly, the cluster
cannot issue a centroid prediction for input data that has missing values in
its numeric fields, so centroid predictions will give a "-" string as output
in this case.

You can change the number of centroids used to group the data in the
clustering procedure

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler cluster --dataset dataset/53b1f71437203f5ac30004ed \
                    --k 3

And also generate the datasets associated to each centroid of a cluster.
Using the ``--cluster-datasets`` option

    bigmler cluster --cluster cluster/53b1f71437203f5ac30004f0 \
                    --cluster-datasets "Cluster 1,Cluster 2"

you can generate the datasets associated to a comma-separated list of
centroid names. If no centroid name is provided, all datasets are generated.


Similarly, you can generate the models to predict if one instance is associated
to each centroid of a cluster.
Using the ``--cluster-models`` option

    bigmler cluster --cluster cluster/53b1f71437203f5ac30004f0 \
                    --cluster-models "Cluster 1,Cluster 2"

you can generate the models associated to a comma-separated list of
centroid names. If no centroid name is provided, all models are generated.
Models can be useful to see which features are important to determine whether
a certain instance belongs to a concrete cluster.

.. _bigmler-anomaly:

Anomaly subcommand
------------------

The ``bigmler anomaly`` subcommand generates all the resources needed to buid
an anomaly detection model and/or predict the anomaly scores associated to your
test data. As usual, the simplest call

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler anomaly --train data/tiny_kdd.csv

uploads the data in the ``data/tiny_kdd.csv`` file and generates
the corresponding ``source``, ``dataset`` and ``anomaly`` objects in BigML. You
can use any of the generated objects to produce new anomaly detectors.
For instance, you could set a subgroup of the fields of the generated dataset
to produce a different anomaly detector by using

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler anomaly --dataset dataset/53b1f71437203f5ac30004ed \
                    --anomaly-fields="-urgent"

that would exclude the field ``urgent`` from the anomaly detector
creation input fields. You can also change the number of top anomalies
enclosed in the anomaly detector list and the number of trees that the anomaly
detector iforest uses. The default values are 10 top anomalies and 128 trees
per iforest:

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler anomaly --dataset dataset/53b1f71437203f5ac30004ed \
                    --top-n 15 --forest-size 50

with this code, the anomaly detector is built using an iforest of 50 trees and
will produce a list of the 15 top anomalies.

Similarly to the models and datasets, the generated anomaly detectors
can be shared using the ``--shared`` option, e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler anomaly --source source/53b1f71437203f5ac30004e0 \
                    --shared

will generate a secret link for both the created dataset and anomaly detector
that can be used to share the resource selectively.

The anomaly detector can be used to assign an anomaly score to each new
input data set. The anomaly score is a number between 0 (not anomalous)
and 1 (highest anomaly). The command

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler anomaly --anomaly anomaly/53b1f71437203f5ac30005c0 \
                    --test data/test_kdd.csv

would produce a file ``anomaly_scores.csv`` with the anomaly score associated
to each input. When the command is executed, the anomaly detector
information is downloaded
to your local computer and the anomaly score predictions are computed locally,
with no more latencies involved. Just in case you prefer to use BigML
to compute the anomaly score predictions remotely, you can do so too

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler anomaly --anomaly anomaly/53b1f71437203f5ac30005c0 \
                    --test data/my_test.csv --remote

would create a remote source and dataset from the test file data,
generate a ``batch anomaly score`` also remotely and finally
download the result to your computer. If you prefer the result not to be
dowloaded but to be stored as a new dataset remotely, add ``--no-csv`` and
``to-dataset`` to the command line. This can be specially helpful when
dealing with a high number of scores or when adding to the final result
the original dataset fields with ``--prediction-info full``, that may result
in a large CSV to be created as output.

Similarly, you can split your data in train/test datasets to build the
anomaly detector and create batch anomaly scores with the test portion of
data

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler anomaly --train data/tiny_kdd.csv --test-split 0.2 --remote

or if you want to apply the anomaly detector on the same training data set
to create a batch anomaly score, use:

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler anomaly --train data/tiny_kdd.csv --score --remote

To extract the top anomalies as a new dataset, or to exclude from the training
dataset the top anomalies in the anomaly detector, set the
 ``--anomalies-dataset`` to ``ìn`` or ``out`` respectively:

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler anomaly --dataset dataset/53b1f71437203f5ac30004ed \
                    --anomalies-dataset out

will create a new dataset excluding the top anomalous instances according
to the anomaly detector.

.. _bigmler-sample:

Sample subcommand
-----------------

You can extract samples from your datasets in BigML using the
``bigmler sample`` subcommand. When a new sample is requested, a copy
of the dataset is stored in a special format in an in-memory cache.
This sample can then be used, before its expiration time, to
extract data from the related dataset by setting some options like the
number of rows or the fields to be retrieved. You can either begin from
scratch uploading your data to BigML, creating the corresponding source and
dataset and extracting your sample from it

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler sample --train data/iris.csv --rows 10 --row-offset 20

This command will create a source, a dataset, a sample object, whose id will
be stored in the ``samples`` file in the output directory,
and extract 10 rows of data
starting from the 21st that will be stored in the ``sample.csv`` file.

You can reuse an existing sample by using its id in the command.



.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler sample --sample sample/53b1f71437203f5ac303d5c0 \
                   --sample-header --row-order-by="-petal length" \
                   --row-fields "petal length,petal width" --mode linear

will create a new ``sample.csv`` file with a headers row where only the
``petal length`` and ``petal width`` are retrieved. The ``--mode linear``
option will cause the first available rows to be returned and the
``--row-order-by="-petal length"`` option returns these rows sorted in
descending order according to the contents of ``petal length``.

You can also add to the sample rows some statistical information by using the
``--stat-field`` or ``--stat-fields`` options. Adding them to the command
will generate a ``stat-info.json`` file where the Pearson's and Spearman's
correlations, and linear regression terms will be stored in a JSON format.

You can also apply a filter to select the sample rows by the values in
their fields using the ``--fields-filter`` option. This must be set to
a string containing the conditions that must be met using field ids
and values.



.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler sample --sample sample/53b1f71437203f5ac303d5c0 \
                   --fields-filter "000001=&!000004=Iris-setosa"

With this command, only rows where field id ``000001`` is missing and
field id ``000004`` is not ``Iris-setosa`` will be retrieved. You can check
the available operators and syntax in the
`samples' developers doc <https://bigml.com/developers/samples#filtering-ro>`_ .
More available
options can be found in the `Samples subcommand Options <#samples-option>`_
section.


Reify subcommand
-----------------

This subcommand extracts the information in the existing resources to determine
the arguments that were used when they were created,
and generates scripts that could be used to reproduce them. Currently, the
language used in the scripts will be ``Python``. The usual starting
point for BigML resources is a ``source`` created from inline, local or remote
data. Thus, the script keeps analyzing the chain of calls that led to a
certain resource until the root ``source`` is found.

The simplest example would be:


.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler reify --id source/55d77ba60d052e23430027bb

that will output:


.. code-block:: python


    """Python code to reify source/55d77ba60d052e23430027bb

    """

    from bigml.api import BigML
    api = BigML()

    source1 = api.create_source("iris.csv", {"name": "my source"})
    api.ok(source1)

According to this output, the source was created from a file named ``iris.csv``
and was assigned a ``name``. This script will be stored in the command output
directory and named `reify.py`` (you can specify a different name and location
using the ``--output``
option).

When creating sources from data, field types are inferred from the contents
of the first lines in the uploaded file. Sometimes, these field types must be
adapted and the ``source`` fields attributes are updated. You can also
change other fields attributes, like their name, label or description.
In order to make sure
that the right fields information is reproduced, add the ``--add-fields`` flag:

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler reify --id source/55d77ba60d052e23430027bb --add-fields \
                  --output my_dir/reify_source.py



.. code-block:: python

    """Python code to reify source/55d77ba60d052e23430027bb

    """

    from bigml.api import BigML
    api = BigML()

    source1 = api.create_source("iris.csv")
    api.ok(source1)

    source1 = api.update_source(source1, \
        {'fields': {u'000004': {'optype': u'categorical', 'name': u'species'},
                    u'000002': {'optype': u'numeric', 'name': u'petal length'},
                    u'000003': {'optype': u'numeric', 'name': u'petal width'},
                    u'000000': {'optype': u'numeric', 'name': u'sepal length'},
                    u'000001': {'optype': u'numeric', 'name': u'sepal width'}}
        }
    )
    api.ok(source1)


Other resources will have more complex workflows and more user-given
attributes. Let's see for instance the
script to generate an evaluation from a train/test split of a source that
was created using the
``bigmler --train data/iris.csv --evaluate`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler reify --id evaluation/55d919850d052e234b000833


.. code-block:: python


    """Python code to reify evaluation/55d919850d052e234b000833

    """

    from bigml.api import BigML
    api = BigML()

    source1 = api.create_source("iris.csv", {'category': 12,
        'description': u'Created using BigMLer',
        'name': u'BigMLer_SunAug2315_025314',
        'tags': [u'BigMLer', u'BigMLer_SunAug2315_025314']})
    api.ok(source1)

    dataset1 = api.create_dataset(source1,
        {'name': u'BigMLer_SunAug2315_025314',
         'tags': [u'BigMLer', u'BigMLer_SunAug2315_025314']})
    api.ok(dataset1)

    model1 = api.create_model(dataset1,
        {'seed': u'BigML, Machine Learning made easy',
         'sample_rate': 0.8, 'name': u'BigMLer_SunAug2315_025314'})
    api.ok(model1)

    evaluation1 = api.create_evaluation(model1, dataset1,
        {'seed': u'BigML, Machine Learning made easy', 'sample_rate': 0.8,
         'out_of_bag': True, 'name': u'BigMLer_SunAug2315_025314'})
    api.ok(evaluation1)

As you can see, BigMLer has added a default ``category``, ``name``,
``description``, ``tags``, has built the model on 80% of the data
and used the ``out_of_bag`` attribute for the
evaluation to use the remaining part of the dataset test data.



.. _bigmler-delete:

Delete subcommand
-----------------

You have seen that BigMLer is an agile tool that empowers you to create a
great number of resources easily. This is a tremedous help, but it also can
lead to a garbage-prone environment. To keep a control of each new created
remote resource use the flag `--resources-log` followed by the name of the log
file you choose.

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --resources-log my_log.log

Each new resource created by that command will cause its id to be appended as
a new line of the log file.

BigMLer can help you as well in deleting these resources. Using the `delete`
subcommand there are many options available. For instance, deleting a
comma-separated list of ids

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler delete \
            --ids source/50a2bb64035d0706db0006cc,dataset/50a1f441035d0706d9000371

deleting resources listed in a file

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler delete --from-file to_delete.log

where `to_delete.log` contains a resource id per line.

As we've previously seen, each BigMLer command execution generates a
bunch of remote resources whose ids are stored in files located in a directory
that can be set using the ``--output-dir`` option. The
``bigmler delete`` subcommand can retrieve the ids stored in such files by
using the ``--from-dir`` option.


.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --output my_BigMLer_output_dir
    bigmler delete --from-dir my_BigMLer_output_dir

The last command will delete all the remote resources previously generated by
the fist command by retrieving their ids from the files in
``my_BigMLer_output_dir`` directory.

You can also delete resources based on the tags they are associated to

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler delete --all-tag my_tag

or restricting the operation to a specific type

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler delete --source-tag my_tag
    bigmler delete --dataset-tag my_tag
    bigmler delete --model-tag my_tag
    bigmler delete --prediction-tag my_tag
    bigmler delete --evaluation-tag my_tag
    bigmler delete --ensemble-tag my_tag
    bigmler delete --batch-prediction-tag my_tag
    bigmler delete --cluster-tag my_tag
    bigmler delete --centroid-tag my_tag
    bigmler delete --batch-centroid-tag my_tag
    bigmler delete --anomaly-tag my_tag
    bigmler delete --anomaly-score-tag my_tag
    bigmler delete --batch-anomaly-score-tag my_tag


You can also delete resources by date. The options ``--newer-than`` and
``--older-than`` let you specify a reference date. Resources created after and
before that date respectively, will be deleted. Both options can be combined to
set a range of dates. The allowed values are:

- dates in a YYYY-MM-DD format
- integers, that will be interpreted as number of days before now
- resource id, the creation datetime of the resource will be used

Thus,



.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler delete --newer-than 2

will delete all resources created less than two days ago (now being
2014-03-23 14:00:00.00000, its creation time will be greater
than 2014-03-21 14:00:00.00000).



.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler delete --older-than 2014-03-20 --newer-than 2014-03-19

will delete all resources created during 2014, March the 19th (creation time
between 2014-03-19 00:00:00 and 2014-03-20 00:00:00) and



.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler delete --newer-than source/532db2b637203f3f1a000104

will delete all resources created after the ``source/532db2b637203f3f1a000104``
was created.

You can also combine both types of options, to delete sources tagged as
``my_tag`` starting from a certain date on

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler delete --newer-than 2 --source-tag my_tag

And finally, you can filter the type of resource to be deleted using the
``--resource-types`` option to specify a comma-separated list of resource
types to be deleted

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler delete --older-than 2 --resource-types source,model

will delete the sources and models created more than two days ago.

You can simulate the a delete subcommand using the ``--dry-run``
flag

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler delete --newer-than source/532db2b637203f3f1a000104 \
                   --source-tag my_source --dry-run

The output for the command will be a list of resources that would be deleted
if the ``--dry-run`` flag was removed. In this case, they will be sources
that contain the tag ``my_source`` and were created after the one given as
``--newer-than`` value. The first 15 resources will be logged
to console, and the complete list can be found in the ``bigmler_sessions``
file.

Additional Features
===================

Using local models to predict
-----------------------------

Most of the previously described commands need the remote resources to
be downloaded to work. For instance, when you want to create a new
model from an existing dataset, BigMLer is going to download the dataset
JSON structure to extract the fields and objective field information,
and only then ask for the model creation. As mentioned,
the ``--store`` flag forces BigMLer to store the downloaded JSON
structures in local files inside your output directory. If you use that flag
when building a model with BigMLer, then the model is stored in your computer.
This model file contains all the information you need in order to make
new predictions, so you can use the
``--model-file`` option to set the path to this file and predict
the value of your objective field for new input data with no reference at all
to your remote resources. You could even delete the original remote model and
work exclusively with the locally downloaded file

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --model-file my_dir/model_532db2b637203f3f1a000136 \
            --test data/test_iris.csv

The same is available for clusters

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler cluster --cluster-file my_dir/cluster_532db2b637203f3f1a000348 \
                    --test data/test_diabetes.csv

or anomaly detectors

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler anomaly --anomaly-file my_dir/anomaly_532db2b637203f3f1a00053a \
                    --test data/test_kdd.csv

Even for ensembles

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --ensemble-file my_dir/ensemble_532db2b637203f3f1a00053b \
            --test data/test_iris.csv --store

where we added the ``--store`` flag to ensure that also the downloaded models
that set up the ensemble are stored and used from the local repository.


Resuming Previous Commands
--------------------------

Network connections failures or other external causes can break the BigMLer
command process. To resume a command ended by an unexpected event you
can issue

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --resume

BigMLer keeps track of each command you issue in a ``.bigmler`` file and of
the output directory in ``.bigmler_dir_stack`` of your working directory.
Then ``--resume`` will recover the last issued command and try to continue
work from the point it was stopped. There's also a ``--stack-level`` flag

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --resume --stack-level 1

to allow resuming a previous command in the stack. In the example, the one
before the last.


Building reports
----------------

The resources generated in the execution of a BigMLer command are listed in
the standard output by default,
but they can be summarized as well in a ``Gazibit`` format.
`Gazibit <http://gazibit.com/>`_ is a platform where you can create interactive
presentations in a
flexible and dynamic way. Using BigMLer's ``--reports gazibit`` option you'll
be able to generate a ``Gazibit`` summary report of your newly created
resources. In
case you use also the ``--shared`` flag, a second template will be generated
where the links for the shared resources will be used. Both reports will be
stored in the ``reports`` subdirectory of your output directory, where all of
the files generated by the BigMLer command are. Thus,



.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --reports gazibit --shared \
            --output-dir my_dir

will generate two files: ``gazibit.json`` and ``gazibit_shared.json`` in a
``reports`` subdirectory of your ``my_dir`` directory. In case you provide
your ``Gazibit token`` in the ``GAZIBIT_TOKEN`` environment variable, they will
also be uploaded to your account in ``Gazibit``. Upload can be avoided, by
using the ``--no-upload`` flag.


User Chosen Defaults
--------------------

BigMLer will look for ``bigmler.ini`` file in the working directory where
users can personalize the default values they like for the most relevant flags.
The options should be written in a config style, e.g.

.. code-block:: bash


    [BigMLer]
    dev = true
    resources_log = ./my_log.log

as you can see, under a ``[BigMLer]`` section the file should contain one line
per option. Dashes in flags are transformed to undescores in options.
The example would keep development mode on and would log all created
resources to ``my_log.log`` for any new ``bigmler`` command issued under the
same working directory if none of the related flags are set.

Naturally, the default value options given in this file will be overriden by
the corresponding flag value in the present command. To follow the previous
example, if you use

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --resources-log ./another_log.log

in the same working directory, the value of the flag will be preeminent and
resources will be logged in ``another_log.log``. For boolean-valued flags,
such as ``--dev`` itself, you'll need to use the associated negative flags to
overide the default behaviour. Than is, following the former example if you
want to override the dev mode used by default you should use

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --no-dev

The set of negative flags is:

Support
=======

Please report problems and bugs to our `BigML.io issue
tracker <https://github.com/bigmlcom/io/issues>`_.

Discussions about the different bindings take place in the general
`BigML mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/bigml>`_. Or join us
in our `Campfire chatroom <https://bigmlinc.campfirenow.com/f20a0>`_.

Requirements
============

Python 2.7 and 3 are currently supported by BigMLer.

BigMLer requires `bigml 4.1.5 <https://github.com/bigmlcom/python>`_  or
higher. Using proportional missing strategy will additionally request
the use of the `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ and
`scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_ libraries. They are not
automatically installed as a dependency, as they are quite heavy and
exclusively required in this case. Therefore, they have been left for
the user to install them if required.

Note that using proportional missing strategy for local predictions can also
require `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ and
`scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_ libraries. They are not installed by
default. Check the bindings documentation for more info.

BigMLer Installation
====================

To install the latest stable release with
`pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install bigmler

You can also install the development version of bigmler directly
from the Git repository

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -e git://github.com/bigmlcom/bigmler.git#egg=bigmler

For a detailed description of install instructions on Windows see the
`BigMLer on Windows <#bigmler-on-windows>`_ section.


BigML Authentication
====================

All the requests to BigML.io must be authenticated using your username
and `API key <https://bigml.com/account/apikey>`_ and are always
transmitted over HTTPS.

BigML module will look for your username and API key in the environment
variables ``BIGML_USERNAME`` and ``BIGML_API_KEY`` respectively. You can
add the following lines to your ``.bashrc`` or ``.bash_profile`` to set
those variables automatically when you log in

.. code-block:: bash

    export BIGML_USERNAME=myusername
    export BIGML_API_KEY=ae579e7e53fb9abd646a6ff8aa99d4afe83ac291

Otherwise, you can initialize directly when running the BigMLer
script as follows

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --username myusername --api_key ae579e7e53fb9abd646a6ff8aa99d4afe83ac291

For a detailed description of authentication instructions on Windows see the
`BigMLer on Windows <#bigmler-on-windows>`_ section.


BigMLer on Windows
==================

To install BigMLer on Windows environments, you'll need `Python for Windows
(v.2.7.x) <http://www.python.org/download/>`_ installed.

In addition to that, you'll need the ``pip`` tool to install BigMLer. To
install pip, first you need to open your command line window (write ``cmd`` in
the input field that appears when you click on ``Start`` and hit ``enter``),
download this `python file <https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py>`_
and execute it

.. code-block:: bash

    c:\Python27\python.exe ez_setup.py

After that, you'll be able to install ``pip`` by typing the following command

.. code-block:: bash

    c:\Python27\Scripts\easy_install.exe pip

And finally, to install BigMLer, just type

.. code-block:: bash

    c:\Python27\Scripts\pip.exe install bigmler

and BigMLer should be installed in your computer. Then
issuing

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --version

should show BigMLer version information.

Finally, to start using BigMLer to handle your BigML resources, you need to
set your credentials in BigML for authentication. If you want them to be
permanently stored in your system, use

.. code-block:: bash

    setx BIGML_USERNAME myusername
    setx BIGML_API_KEY ae579e7e53fb9abd646a6ff8aa99d4afe83ac291

Remember that ``setx`` will not change the environment variables of your actual
console, so you will need to open a new one to start using them.

BigML Development Mode
======================

Also, you can instruct BigMLer to work in BigML's Sandbox
environment by using the parameter ``--dev``

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --dev

Using the development flag you can run tasks under 1 MB without spending any of
your BigML credits.

Using BigMLer
=============

To run BigMLer you can use the console script directly. The ``--help``
option will describe all the available options

.. code-block:: bash

    bigmler --help

Alternatively you can just call bigmler as follows

.. code-block:: bash

    python bigmler.py --help

This will display the full list of optional arguments. You can read a brief
explanation for each option below.

Prior Versions Compatibility Issues
-----------------------------------

BigMLer will accept flags written with underscore as word separator like
``--clear_logs`` for compatibility with prior versions. Also ``--field-names``
is accepted, although the more complete ``--field-attributes`` flag is
preferred. ``--stat_pruning`` and ``--no_stat_pruning`` are discontinued
and their effects can be achived by setting the actual ``--pruning`` flag
to ``statistical`` or ``no-pruning`` values respectively.

Running the Tests
-----------------

To run the tests you will need to install
`lettuce <http://packages.python.org/lettuce/tutorial/simple.html>`_

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install lettuce

and set up your authentication via environment variables, as explained
above. With that in place, you can run the test suite simply by

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd tests
    $ lettuce

Building the Documentation
==========================

Install the tools required to build the documentation

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install sphinx

To build the HTML version of the documentation

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd docs/
    $ make html

Then launch ``docs/_build/html/index.html`` in your browser.

History
-------

1.6.0 (2014-04-18)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Adding the --shared flag to share the created dataset, model and evaluation

1.5.1 (2014-04-04)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixing bug for model building, when objective field was specified and
  no --max-category was present the user given objective was not used.
- Fixing bug: max-category data stored even when --max-category was not
  used.

1.5.0 (2014-03-24)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Adding --missing-strategy option to allow different prediction strategies
  when a missing value is found in a split field. Available for local
  predictions, batch predictions and evaluations.
- Adding new --delete options: --newer-than and --older-than to delete lists
  of resources according to their creation date.

  equally structured datasets.

1.4.7 (2014-03-14)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Bug fixing: resume from multi-label processing from dataset was not working.
- Bug fixing: max parallel resource creation check did not check that all the
              older tasks ended, only the last of the slot. This caused
              more tasks than permitted to be sent in parallel.
- Improving multi-label training data uploads by zipping the extended file and
  transforming booleans from True/False to 1/0.

1.4.6 (2014-02-21)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  is used, but only if it differs from the existing objective.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Storing the --max-categories info (its number and the chosen `other` label)
  in user_metadata.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fix when using the combined method in --max-categories models.

  objective fields.
- Fix solving objective issues when its column number is zero.

  multi label fields such as count, first or last.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fix in local random forests' predictions. Sometimes the fields used in all
  the models were not correctly retrieved and some predictions could be
  erroneus.

  some cases.

1.2.1 (2014-01-12)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixing problem with --max-categories when the categorical field is not
  a preferred field of the dataset.

  dataset ids are stored, one per line, and now it reads all of them to be
  used in model and ensemble creation.
